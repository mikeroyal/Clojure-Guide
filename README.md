# Clojure Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks

[clojureVSCode](https://github.com/avli/clojureVSCode) is an extension that provides Clojure and ClojureScript support for Visual Studio Code.

[Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) is a minimalistic [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) interface to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

[Riemann](https://riemann.io/) is a network event stream processing system for monitoring distributed systems, in Clojure.

[Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) is an immutable in-memory database and Datalog query engine in Clojure, ClojureScript, and JavaScript.

[Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) is a small routing library for [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) that allows web applications to be composed of small, independent parts.

[Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) is a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack. By abstracting the details of HTTP into a simple, unified API, Ring allows web applications to be constructed of modular components that can be shared among a variety of applications, web servers, and web frameworks.

[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) is a library for representing HTML in Clojure. It uses vectors to represent elements, and maps to represent an element's attributes.

[Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx) is a distributed, masterless, high performance, fault tolerant data processing system.

[Lumo ](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo) is a standalone ClojureScript environment that runs on Node.js and the V8 JavaScript engine. It provides out-of-the-box access to the entire Node.js ecosystem, including a ClojureScript REPL.

[Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) is a Clojure build framework and ad-hoc Clojure script evaluator. Boot provides a runtime environment that includes all of the tools needed to build Clojure projects from scripts written in Clojure.

[Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia) is an integration of the Clojure Programming Language with the Unity 3D game engine.

[Lacinia](https://lacinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a full GraphQL implementation in pure Clojure.
