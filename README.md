# Clojure Learning Resources

[Clojure](https://clojure.org/) is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.

[ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) is a compiler for Clojure that targets JavaScript. It is designed to emit JavaScript code which is compatible with the advanced compilation mode of the Google Closure optimizing compiler.

# Clojure Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.

[Code Server](https://coder.com/) is a tool that allows you to run [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on any machine anywhere and access it in the browser.

[clojureVSCode](https://github.com/avli/clojureVSCode) is an extension that provides Clojure and ClojureScript support for Visual Studio Code.

[Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) is a minimalistic [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) interface to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

[Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) is  an integrated REPL powered environment for enjoyable and productive [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It includes inline code evaluation, [Paredit](https://calva.io/paredit/), a Clojure formatter, a test runner, Clojure syntax highlighting, and more. Most of the REPL power is harvested from the produce of [The Orchard](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard).

[Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/index.html) is a Clojure(Script) IDE with advanced structural editing, refactorings, VCS integration and much more, all out of the box.

[Clj and deps.edn](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) is a tool for managing dependencies, running a REPL, and executing Clojure programs, built by the Clojure core team.

[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) is an extensible build tool that provides dependency management, REPL support, testing, packaging, deployment, and many other capabilities.

[Boot](https://boot-clj.github.io/) is a build tooling for Clojure: instead of a special-purpose DSL, Boot supplies abstractions and libraries you can use to automate nearly any build scenario with the full power of the Clojure language.

[Clojars](https://clojars.org/) is a Clojure-focused Maven repository.

[Clojure Toolbox](https://www.clojure-toolbox.com/) is  a categorized index of Clojure libraries.

[Vim Firepalce](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace) is a plugin in Vim that adds support for [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/).

[CIDER](https://cider.mx/) is a plugin extends Emacs with support for interactive programming in Clojure. The features are centered around cider-mode, an Emacs minor-mode that complements clojure-mode project.

[Clojure-mode](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode) is a Emacs major mode that provides font-lock (syntax highlighting), indentation, navigation and refactoring support for the Clojure(Script).

[Inf-clojure](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure) is a package that provides basic interaction with a Clojure subprocess (REPL), based on ideas from the popular inferior-lisp package.

[Riemann](https://riemann.io/) is a network event stream processing system for monitoring distributed systems, in Clojure.

[Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) is an immutable in-memory database and Datalog query engine in Clojure, ClojureScript, and JavaScript.

[Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) is a small routing library for [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) that allows web applications to be composed of small, independent parts.

[Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) is a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack. By abstracting the details of HTTP into a simple, unified API, Ring allows web applications to be constructed of modular components that can be shared among a variety of applications, web servers, and web frameworks.

[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) is a library for representing HTML in Clojure. It uses vectors to represent elements, and maps to represent an element's attributes.

[Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx) is a distributed, masterless, high performance, fault tolerant data processing system.

[Lumo ](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo) is a standalone ClojureScript environment that runs on Node.js and the V8 JavaScript engine. It provides out-of-the-box access to the entire Node.js ecosystem, including a ClojureScript REPL.

[Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) is a Clojure build framework and ad-hoc Clojure script evaluator. Boot provides a runtime environment that includes all of the tools needed to build Clojure projects from scripts written in Clojure.

[Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia) is an integration of the Clojure Programming Language with the Unity 3D game engine.

[Lacinia](https://lacinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a full GraphQL implementation in pure Clojure.
